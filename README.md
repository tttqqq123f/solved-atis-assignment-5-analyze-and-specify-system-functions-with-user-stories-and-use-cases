We dive deeper into the functional requirements of our system and formulate user stories and use cases. We analyze functional dependencies by creating a goal hierarchy. Remember to make your requirements SMART.

<ul>

 <li>Formulate 3 <u>high-level</u> user stories at the white level with at least one acceptance criterion that you describe in detail.</li>

 <li>Check each story based on the INVEST acronym and summarize your considerations in a few words.</li>

 <li>How do you ensure that the acceptance criterion is measurable?</li>

 <li>Select one of the user stories and write a corresponding use case using the template in slide deck A5.</li>

 <li>Disassemble the use case and create one goal hierarchy for this use case, which shows how to refine it into its lower level goals. Assign a color level to each goal as proposed by Cockburn. Make sure you use all color levels to refine your goal hierarchy from white down to indigo or even black (technical details at the “shell” level). If you find that that this is not possible, revise your user story and use case: o Was it high- level enough? o Did your use case description show enough detail?</li>

</ul>
